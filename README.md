# React Front-End Boilerplate

## Description

Welcome to React Front-End Boilerplate! This boilerplate provides a solid foundation for building React applications with features such as pre-configured Redux setup, route protection, Material-UI (Mui), styled-components, and SCSS. It is designed to support a multi-tenant architecture, offering flexibility and scalability.

## Features

- **Redux Integration:** The project is equipped with Redux for efficient global state management.

- **Route Protection:** Ensure security through built-in route protection, controlling access for a seamless user experience.

- **Material-UI (Mui):** Utilize Material-UI components and design principles for a modern and visually appealing user interface.

- **Styled-Components with SCSS:** Leverage the benefits of styled-components and SCSS for enhanced styling capabilities and a modular codebase.

- **Multi-Tenant Architecture:** This application supports a multi-tenant architecture, accommodating multiple customers or tenants within a single instance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zeeshan-thedeveloper/react-front-end-boilerplate.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd react-front-end-boilerplate
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Usage

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application in action.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build in the `build` directory.
